        My name is Owen Padula, I am currently majoring in information management and technology and plan to add on a second major of business. I am interested in using technology to understand data and make decisions. I can code with Java and am proficient in my use with most current technology. Some of my other skills include video editing and computer hardware. Outside of school my two biggest hobbies are gaming and snowboarding. When I am not taking classes I frequently travel.
